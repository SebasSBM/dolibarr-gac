dolibarr-gac
============
This is a project to add a new WebService request to Dolibarr.

For now it is UNDER DEVELOPING. I use vim and I make identations with tab=4.

All editions I make have a tag (sbm_mod) in a comment aside. I also use tags like
TODO, FIXME or XXX.

For now the code just doesn't work.
